        What is Henna?
        The word ‘henna’ is understood by people around the world in many different ways. A majority of people probably associate it with the dark-red/brown dye for hair and skin that is traditionally used in many cultures, but the name also applies to the flowering plant from which the dye is derived.

        As the sole species in the Lawsonia genus, henna has many different names across the globe, including hina and Egyptian privet, but they are all describing the same remarkable plant, which has the scientific name Lawsonia inermis. [1] You can identify a henna plant with its small white or pink flowers, as well as the small fruit it bears.

        It can be used in a wide variety of ways, including its dye form, as well as in aqueous extracts, tinctures, and salves, composed of the bark, seeds, or leaves. This versatility makes henna a very valuable element in traditional medicines, particularly Ayurvedic practice.

        Henna oil, bark, and seeds are the most common forms for medicinal benefits, and the high concentration of chemicals and nutrients in the plant gives it anti-inflammatory, hypotensive, antibacterial, astringent, and antiviral effects.
